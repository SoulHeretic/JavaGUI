# JavaGUI
A small program that uses some Java GUI for an assignment in 2020

In this lab, you will create a GUI application.  This application starts with a window containing 7 buttons with 1-7 stars on them (* to *******), in a horizontal line and in random order.  The random order should be different each time the program runs.  Initially, only the * button should be enabled (setDisable(false)), but clicking that button should disable it (setDisable(true)) and enable the ** button.  Likewise, ** disables itself and enables ***, and so forth, with ******* enabling nothing.
